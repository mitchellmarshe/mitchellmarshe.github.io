It is with his renovations of the Romanesque St. Denis Abbey’s choir through the years 1140-1144 that set the Gothic style \n                  in stone. This choir features ribbed vaults and multistoried stain glass windows that let in massive amounts of light compared to \n                  the bulky and dark Romanesque style of churches. Abbot Suger’s intentions were to create a house of God, a place of divine light \n                  that represents heaven for mankind. But all of this could not have happened if it weren’t for the invention of the flying buttress. \n                  In essence, the flying buttress is a massive pier with a half arch made of stone blocks that connect to the side of a cathedral \n                  wall where on the other side of the wall is the lower part of a groin vault or pointed arch. The flying buttress allows stone \n                  walls to be thinner, taller, and contain more voids with glass because this architectural device pushes against the cathedral \n                  walls in opposite of thrusts forces from the weight of the stone groin vaults and massive wooden trusses.<sup>1</sup> Over the \n                  centuries, the flying buttress has been much of an experiment out of the disasters with its implementation of form and style in \n                  efforts to keep up with the demand of building taller Gothic cathedrals. \n                </p>\n                <div class=\"card\" style={ArticleStyles.ImageLeft}>\n                  <img class=\"card-img-top\" src={require(\"C:/Users/mitch/Desktop/portfolio/src/images/st-denis.jpg\")} alt=\"St-Denis\" />\n                  <div class=\"card-body\">\n                    <h4 class=\"card-title\"> Fig. 1</h4>\n                    <p class=\"card-text\">\n                      The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, \"Abbaye De Saint-Denis,\" Digital image.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.LineIndent}>\n                  The earliest form of the flying buttress is that of simple massive piers that extend from the outer walls of aisles while the \n                  upper part of the piers jets out a thin half arch into the outer walls of the nave. This form of the flying buttress appears at \n                  St. Denis’ Abbey and in other Gothic cathedrals until 1175, where the form stops at St. Remi, in Reims, France. Both St. Denis’ \n                  Abbey and St. Remi have similar flying buttresses on the outer walls of the choir; therefore, I will focus on St. Denis’ Abbey \n                  as it is the start of the Gothic architecture. Towards the left is an image of St. Denis Abbey’s flying buttresses that radiate \n                  around the choir forming an exoskeleton. In the bottom-right, there is a man hunching over. His width is about the thickness of \n                  one of these buttress piers. Also observe that the spanning of the flyer is proportional to the width of the piers by the \n                  Golden Ratio. Lastly, geometry and physics play a critical role into the placement of each buttress as each relate to the \n                  alignment and lateral stress load from the pointed arches of the ribbed vault underneath the conical part of the roof.<sup>2</sup>\n                </p>\n                <div style={{overflow: 'auto'}}>\n                  <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                    <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}>\n                      1.

Some people criticized the use of the flying \n                  buttress as being a barbaric form of architecture that doesn’t conceal its structure and present beauty. Thus, the critics \n                  coined this style of architecture as Gothic after the barbaric Goths.<sup>2</sup> As the decades passed by, it seems as though \n                  this style of architecture was proving itself to be barbaric in the ways that many of these grand cathedrals had severe \n                  structural instability.\n                </p>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                  <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}>\n                    2.

Before I depart, St. Denis’ Abbey, \n                  I’d like to point out that its flying buttress features a second flyer and a nonfunctioning pinnacle, which is that ornate \n                  piece of stone at the top of the pier. These two features were employed over the centuries as St. Denis’ Abbey was beginning \n                  to sink and twist into the ground from the massive stresses from the heavy vaults. \n                </p>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.LineIndent}>\n                  The second flyer and pinnacle are modifications of the Gothic buttress system in the second phase of its form and style where \n                  double flyers and piers are used in the cathedrals throughout the years, 1200-1350. One of the best documented and grand \n                  cathedrals of this period is Amiens Cathedral in France (Fig. 2). Here at Amiens, the cathedral boasts two double aisles and \n                  a massive central nave that soars well over 300 feet with many ribbed vaults weighing in at 20 tons. To keep this cathedral \n                  from toppling over, the use of double flyers and buttress piers with pinnacles are employed here. The flyers are open arcades \n                  of scaling gothic arches within two flyers. The double piers are dressed with columns, niches, and gable roofs.<sup>3</sup> In \n                  addition, the piers have pinnacles which are the upward extension that resemble much like a capital to a column. These \n                  pinnacles are highly decorative, but serve a functional purpose of stabilizing the piers from shifting over from the stresses \n                  of the ribbed vaults.<sup>4</sup>\n                </p>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                  <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}>\n                    3.

Jacques Heyman is an engineer \n                  and professor at the University of Cambridge, who over the many years has studied the structural features of the Gothic \n                  cathedrals and written the two books, The Stone Skeleton, and Arches, Vaults, and Buttresses. In these two books, Heyman \n                  explains that in order to make a proper flyer and buttress requires the upmost proportional and symmetrical design to \n                  carry various thrust loads into the ground, but also the whole system must resist wind forces. He says that the stability \n                  in Gothic cathedrals comes from the massing of the pier and that the double pier system greatly helps in separating the \n                  loads of stress from the groin vaults but also resists wind forces that wane the building back and forth. Whereas, the \n                  double flyers connect the piers to the nave with an arc that carries two different thrust forces. The upper flyers send \n                  the thrust forces from the trusses of the roof at a 45-degree angle down towards the two piers. While the lower flyers \n                  carry the outwards forces from the groin vault into an arc that passing through each pier and into the ground. If the \n                  alignment of the flyers to the connecting vault is off, then the thrusting forces never reach the ground which is very \n                  problematic in Gothic cathedrals because many have fallen, such as Beauvais Cathedral, due to this error of construction.<sup>5</sup>\n                </p>\n                <div style={{overflow: 'auto'}}>\n                  <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                    <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}> \n                      5.

Amiens Cathedral’s buttresses were built simultaneously alongside the walls of the \n                  cathedral. These buttresses are made from hand cut blocks of limestone which were quarried from the finest reserves. Whereas the \n                  flying buttresses of Beauvais Cathedral are poorly made of weak limestone and were built in sections over time (Fig. 3). At both \n                  cathedrals, stoneworkers would erect scaffolding and then hoist these 100-pound blocks into place using pulleys and the human \n                  crank wheel. After each stone was in place, the stonemasons would check that the pier of the buttress or flyer are leveled and \n                  aligned properly according to the plan. When new sections of the buttresses were being finished, Hislop speculates that the \n                  architects and engineers were praying that nothing would collapse because much of their designs are experimental and just pure \n                  ambition to build the next tallest cathedral.<sup>6</sup>\n                </p>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.LineIndent}>\n                  Luckily for Amiens, its intact to this day, but many renovations have occurred since 1270. For instance, an extra set of double \n                  flyers are placed slightly lower than the old set to handle the forces from the vaults that were once never dealt with. Besides this \n                  slight addition, Amiens is constantly being repaired and refinished. As the old saying goes: “cathedrals are never truly finished.” <sup>6</sup>\n                </p>\n                <div class=\"card\" style={ArticleStyles.ImageLeft}>\n                  <img class=\"card-img-top\" src={require(\"C:/Users/mitch/Desktop/portfolio/src/images/beauvais.jpg\")} alt=\"Beauvais\" />\n                  <div class=\"card-body\">\n                    <h4 class=\"card-title\"> Fig. 3</h4>\n                    <p class=\"card-text\">\n                      Pepijntje, \"Beauvais Cathedral From the East,\" Digital image.\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style={{overflow: 'auto'}}>\n                  <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                    <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}> \n                      6.

However, in 1284, the transept failed and collapsed upon \n                  itself after standing for 12 years at well over 350 feet.  The failure is the result of poor materials, unorganized construction and that the \n                  flyers were unaligned with the large vault over the transept.<sup>7</sup> Today, Beauvais Cathedral is under constant threat of collapsing into \n                  complete ruins. Engineers have built many wooden scaffolds and buttresses inside while also adding iron chain bands around the outside of the \n                  remaining buttresses that still hold. Along with the maintenance are the daily prayers from brave priests, who hope that Beauvais Cathedral \n                  doesn’t parish as it is their piece of heaven. \n                </p>\n                <p style={ArticleStyles.LineIndent}>\n                  Towards the end of the Gothic era, cathedrals were becoming more ornate overall and so were the flying buttresses in hopes of creating a place \n                  of heaven and light. Throughout the years 1350-1500, more complicated cathedrals, such as Westminster Abbey, have a double buttress with a \n                  triple flyer, each connecting to either a fan vault or truss. Also at Westminster Abbey is the Lady’s Chapel which features a double flying \n                  buttress with scaling medallions while on the upper flyer has sculptures of gargoyles. Finally, the piers have niches with sculptures of saints \n                  and gargoyles with spouts that are early forms of a gutter system to keep the limestone from wearing down so much.<sup>7</sup> \n                </p>\n                <div class=\"card\" style={ArticleStyles.ImageRight}>\n                  <img class=\"card-img-top\" src={require(\"C:/Users/mitch/Desktop/portfolio/src/images/westminster.jpg\")} alt=\"Westminster\" />\n                  <div class=\"card-body\">\n                    <h4 class=\"card-title\"> Fig. 4</h4>\n                    <p class=\"card-text\">\n                      James Brittain, \"Westminster Abbey, London, United Kingdom.

From the beginning to the end of the Gothic style, flying buttresses transformed \n                  from a simple functioning mass to an ornate and admirable piece of stonework. Throughout the evolution of the flying buttresses, \n                  architects and stonemasons prayed that their designs work in the hast of building the next tallest and grandest cathedral among \n                  their neighbors. But no matter what they did, the flying buttress did not quite solve the physic problems of the cathedral. By \n                  the 1400s, cathedral builders employed iron chains inside the central nave from one column to the next to hold the inner thrusts \n                  of the structure from caving in. Even this effort isn’t enough to make cathedrals of the late Gothic era sound because the ornate \n                  features of the limestone cathedrals and buttress systems created a massive surface area for further deterioration. This and other \n                  problems of cathedral design pertaining mainly towards the buttress system diminished the uses of it.<sup>8</sup> Despite the \n                  failures of the flying buttress system, if it weren’t for Abbot Suger’s vision of St. Denis’ Abbey, then perhaps today we would \n                  not have skyscrapers.\n                </p>\n                <div style={{overflow: 'auto'}}>\n                  <p style={ArticleStyles.BlockIndent}>\n                    <div style={ArticleStyles.HangLineIndent}>\n                      8.

This site is called the Palace of Nestor at Pylos; its discovery \n                  came about in 1939 when archeologist, Carl W. Blegen scoured the hill of Epano Englianos with his colleges in search of the home to \n                  the buried Mycenaean royalists in a nearby tholos. What has been recovered at the Palace of Nestor is the stone foundations and \n                  footings of the exterior and interior walls. This leftover footprint shows a megaron structure housing a throne room. Around the \n                  megaron are many rectilinear rooms accessible by hallways and doorways. Inside these rooms are intact bronze trading seals, \n                  clay-painted pottery, stone Linear B tablets, or fragments of frescos that covered the walls.<sup>1</sup> With these artifacts \n                  we are able to gather insight into this advanced civilization’s palace architecture in terms of structure, function, and experience.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  The structure of the Palace of Nestor is heavily influenced by Egyptian and Minoan architecture concepts that are employed around \n                  a megaron in a centralized plan that emphasizes organization, flow, and defense. The entrance to the palace, rooms 1 and 2, most \n                  likely looked like an Egyptian propylon modified with a second story covered balcony that shades a double portico entryway. This \n                  is speculated by the remnants of three 1-meter-thick walls intersecting each other in the shape of an H, where the midsection has \n                  a doorway aligned in-between two columns.<sup>2</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                  <i>\n                    From here on, rooms with numbers are references to the Nestor Legend and Site Plan down below.\n                  </i>\n                  <br>\n                  <br>\n                  <!---\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    1.

Furthermore, this entryway is also near the barracks (rooms 55-7).\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Past the entrance is the footprint of a megaron which acts as the heart of the Palace of Nestor by guiding human traffic towards \n                  the throne room. At the front of the megaron is a grand portico (room 4) that leads into a grand vestibule (room 5) which leads \n                  into the throne room (room 6). The grand vestibule also has doorways that lead into the left and right wings and stairwells of \n                  the palace. This allows authorized personnel to access the throne room easily while making access for intruders much harder since \n                  the vestibule and portico would have had guards.<sup>2</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  The throne room is by far the most protected and grander of any room present at the palace. The megaron that protects this throne \n                  room is 1.5-meter-thick of stacked rubble once reinforced with vertical and horizontal timbers and finished with frescos. At the \n                  center of the throne room is an 8” raised ceremonial hearth made of clay and stucco. Around the hearth are four column bases that \n                  had wooden and plaster shafts with 64-flutes capped by Minoan style capitals. The flooring had gridded sets of colorful tiles with \n                  patterns. The ceiling was coffered with painted wooden beams and inset with colorful tiles. Above the hearth was a second story \n                  overlooking balcony. The second floor had two terracotta pipe flumes to exhaust the fumes from the hearth below.<sup>2</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!-----\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    2.

These storage rooms seem to be organized by the type of items they once \n                  stored. In the left wing are smaller storage rooms with clay dishware. In the opposite wing, there are larger storage rooms that \n                  stored perfumes in small clay vases. Towards the back of the megaron are rooms filled with large clay jugs containing the residue \n                  of olive oil.<sup>3</sup> All of these storage rooms once had freestanding wooden shelves and working drain holes through the \n                  stucco pitched flooring.<sup>4</sup> The exterior walls of these storage rooms were made of square cut limestone blocks finished \n                  in plaster.<sup>3</sup> These unique and borrowed architecture concepts is what structures the Palace of Nestor.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Overall the Palace of Nestor functioned as a place of government, trade, and ritualistic site for the Messenia region. The palace \n                  is situated at the pinnacle of Pylos alongside the Old Palace and the Workshop which all face the water towards the northwest and \n                  all connect to southern and northern routes. From these routes people would travel to the Palace of Nestor for trade, religious \n                  festivities, or government affairs. These functions are carried out in the palace’s throne room, archives, courtyards, and storage \n                  rooms.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  The throne room was where the King conducted business and ritualistic sacrifice to the Gods. Before entering the throne room (6), \n                  a guest of business would of have waited in the grand vestibule (room 5) with sentry guards. Once inside the throne room, one could \n                  speak to the King about trade or what-have-you. Otherwise, the throne room was a place of ritualistic affair for the King. Here, \n                  there is a ceremonial hearth in the center.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!---\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    3.

To access the archives, rooms 7 and 8, one would have been a scribe, royalist, or noble considering the security barriers \n                  at the front of the palace. Here, trade and tax was documented on Linear B Tablets and bronze seals, written or stamped by one of \n                  the 26 known scribes at Pylos. One of these tablets left behind explains that workers were paid with figs or grains for services. \n                  Another tablet describes the kingdom as divided into districts all taxed by 6 or so categories from live stock to textile.\n                  <sup>6</sup> The many seals that remain on the floors of the archives are the records of transactions from one merchant to another. \n                  According to Kevin M. Pluta, who wrote the archeological masters dissertation, The Sealings in the Archives Complex at Pylos, the \n                  concept of using seals to document these actions of trade can also be found at Knossos and other Mycenaean cities. The seals often \n                  had the representation of man, man vs. man, man vs. beast, or an animal. All seals are unique to their respected owners of trade \n                  or government. These seals are either coins of bronze or gold, or stamps on parchment via a ring.<sup>7</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Toward the right of palace is a ceremonial courtyard with an aqueduct and bathhouse. The ceremonial courtyard (room 42) and bathhouse \n                  (room 43) are accessed through the right vestibule (room 38).\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!---\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    5.

An additional thought \n                  to this idea of a ceremonial courtyard is that this place is segregated off from the rest of the palace and next door is another \n                  private courtyard. There are also special considerations that have been taken towards this particular courtyard. Here there is a \n                  U-shape aqueduct connecting to the Rouvelli Springs nearby. This aqueduct once filled pots that seem to have been used in ritual \n                  gatherings because also connected to the aqueduct are broken up terracotta pipes, which one runs through and into the bathhouse. \n                  This bathhouse has a tub which may of been used more for ritualistic cleansing than for hygiene.<sup>8</sup> Who knows really.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Lastly, the storages around the megaron held a great reserve of wines, olive oils, perfumes, dishes, and drinking cups. Rooms 104 \n                  and 105 is where wine was made and stored. Rooms 23, 24, and 27 held olive oil. Rooms 30-34 is where perfume was created and preserved. \n                  These stocks of goods were traded and used within the palace. Whereas, rooms 19 and 20 stored 2,853 drinking cups and 6,000 vases \n                  varying of 23 different shapes for ceremonial usage.<sup>9</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Experiencing the Palace of Nestor takes the imagination of placing oneself in the perspective of a noble reaching the throne room. \n                  Starting from the gateway, one would see through a portico an agora (room 58) encapsulated by the Palace of Nestor and the Workshops. \n                  Here at the agora, merchants from across the Messenia region would barter goods to one another and to those of nobility.<sup>10</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!-----\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    8.

For a noble this sense of security is a must, but for anyone else the Palace of Nestor would be \n                  quite intimidating.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  After confirmation from the guards, one would enter the confines of the palace. The main courtyard would be busy with royalists and \n                  nobles a like from which one can easily be well received. Towards the left is an entry way that leads into the left wing and to the \n                  wine tasting room (rooms 9-10) where the finest wines are served in clay cups. After being aquatinted and served, one would walk \n                  towards the grand portico supported by two 64-fluted columns of plaster capped with Minoan stylized capitals. Above the grand portico \n                  is a balcony well decorated in frescos of various patterns much like the rest of the palace surroundings. As one makes way through \n                  the grand portico and sentry guard, a short waiting period with nobles and sentries would ensue inside the grand vestibule.<sup>11</sup>\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  Finally, after the short wait in the grand vestibule, one would be invited by two sentries flanking the doors to the magnificent throne \n                  room. As the two wooden doors push forward into the throne room, one experiences overwhelming grandeur of tiled floors, a great hearth, \n                  fresco painted walls with murals, coffered ceilings, and the presence of the King.<sup>12</sup> \n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!----\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    10.

In the middle is a raised circular ceremonial hearth made of \n                  clay coated with stucco. Surrounding the hearth are four highly decorated wooden and stucco columns. The fumes from the fire within the \n                  hearth rise into the second floor overlook and out through two terracotta pipes above. The ceilings are coffered with tile inlays of \n                  various colors. The fresco wall beyond the hearth depicts the sacrifice of a bull for a banquet of men and women. Toward the right of \n                  the room, above the throne is a wall with a fresco of a bird and a lyre player.<sup>13</sup> Below this mural sat King Nestor where one \n                  could speak of business in front of him. It is said that King Nestor aided in the raid of Troy with 90 vessels alongside the 100 vessels \n                  of Agamemnon.<sup>14</sup> King Nestor’s power and wealth can be seen in his finely crafted throne of wood and ivory inset. Beside the \n                  throne is a basin well for the King to shed blood to the Gods.<sup>13</sup> This is the noble’s experience of approaching the throne room \n                  from the gateway of Pylos.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"LineIndent\">\n                  It is evident that the Mycenaean people at Pylos were a culture very advanced in architecture, especially with the Palace of Nestor as a \n                  defensive structure that secures the various functional rooms which carried out government, trade, and religion while presenting an \n                  experience of grandeur. The Palace of Nestor at Pylos which is perched on a hill much like an acropolis was no doubt an important site \n                  within the Messenia region because the ruler and stocks of tradeable goods are kept here. Thus, the remnants of the Palace of Nestor show \n                  that the Mycenaean people spared the most expense to fortifying this palace and surroundings with thick stone walls reinforced with timber.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"BlockIndent\">\n                    <!-----\n                  <div class=\"HangLineIndent\">\n                    13.

These rooms are also well organized \n                  in a linear plan that resembles much of a modern villa. For the most part, rooms for government or rituals were all highly decorated \n                  in the best materials possible to provide an experience of grandeur. While rooms related to trade featured innovations in drainage \n                  and shelving.
